* Determine that normative RFC 2119 terms (MUST, SHOULD, MAY, etc.) are
  truly intended in all cases where capitalized.

* Document hierarchy WRT headings has a flaw, in that topics related to
  animated WebPs are discussed under subheads of "Single-image WebP
  Files".

* Several passages could be made clearer.

  * Overall edit for scope.  Portions are phrased as an introduction to
    the 0.1.3 RIFF container additions, rather than a holistic guide to
    WebP.

  * To wit, suggest s/[spec|specification]/guide/g .  "Spec" can imply a
    standards track; in any case it's too formal for a work in progress.

  * Sections and passages re "multi-image" should likely be suppressed
    until multi-image drops.

  * Improve the term "Mux-Container".
