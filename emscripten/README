Prerequisites:
==============
See https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Tutorial to setup emscripten.

Building:
=========

$ make -f makefile.em

This will produce libwebpdecoder.js.

An alternate path to emscripten can be passed on the command line:

$ make -f makefile.em EMSCRIPTEN=/my/path/to/emscripten

Running:
========

1) Start a webserver in the root of your git tree.
  $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

2) Open the demo page.
  http://localhost:8080/emscripten/emscripten.html

3) Select an image button to decode one of the files from emscripten/images/.

Known Issues:
=============
* Compatibility hasn't been thoroughly investigated.
  Appears to work with: FireFox 18.0.2, Chrome 25 and
                        Opera 12.14 (only with < -O2 or UNALIGNED_MEMORY=1)
* The first decode is much slower.
* Repeated decodes without a reload may result in a memory error.
