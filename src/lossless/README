This directory contains a lossless compression algorithm that
compresses partially translucent images typically 30 % more densely
than pngcrush. The methods used include:

Backward references (with 2d locality for the closest 120 pixel positions).

Prefixed Huffman coding, like flate, but squares of 2^n x 2^n pixels
can have their own Huffman code. Further, green, red, blue and alpha
have their separate entropy codes. However, green is special: green is
encoded with copy-lengths and "palette hash codes".

Spatial color prediction (for 2^n x 2^n pixel squares), slightly similar to
Paeth predictor in png.

Palette hash codes -- multiplicative hashing based "emerging palette"
compression.

Intercomponent color prediction (for 2^n x 2^n pixel squares).

Sub-resolution images of the entropy codes, spatial color prediction,
and intercomponent color prediction are encoded recursively with the
image format itself.
